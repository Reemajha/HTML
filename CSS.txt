Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

It is used to format the layout of a webpage.
With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between
elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or
background colors are to be used, different displays for
different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

- Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
- Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
- External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file (<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">)

Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border

** The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

- Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

- <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program

Img Tag:
- <img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

Image Map: (Clickable picture)

- The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map,
and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region

Adding a Background Image:
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>

* <style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: 100% 100%; #This will stretch the image. If you want the original size then set it to cover.
}
</style>

Tag	      Description
<img>	    Defines an image
<map>	    Defines an image map
<area>	  Defines a clickable area inside an image map
