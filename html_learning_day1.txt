HTML is the standard markup language for creating webpages.

-The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
-The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
-The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
-The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the
browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
-The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the
visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
-The <h1> element defines a large heading
-The <p> element defines a paragraph

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements
are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

WEB BROWSERS:
- A browser does not display the HTML tags but uses them to determine how to
display the document.

* HTML headings

HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading:

* HTML links are defined with the <a> tag

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

*HTML images

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.
The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

Example
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

- The <br> tag defines a line break.

- HTML is not case sensitive.

* HTML Attributes

- All HTML elements can have attributes
- Attributes are always specified in the start tag
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


In src attribute, There are two ways to specify the URL:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here,
the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash,
it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL
begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Differnet Attributes:

- href
- src
- height
- width
- alt (to write some text for the image, in case, the image is not visible)
- style (<p style="color:blue">This is a blue paragraph </p>)
- lang (<html lang="en-US">) en means english and US means USA as in country.
- title (The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element)


- All HTML elements can have attributes
- The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
- The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
- The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images

- The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
- The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
- The title attribute defines some extra information about an element


- The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
